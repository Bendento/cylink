Flutter Hackathon

I hope you like the app. The hackathon made a lof of fun and i learned so much.

## Introduction of the app

This is an app from the future and shows in which way app-development with Flutter can be used in the future. This is app from 2077, where mostly every person is a cyborg. It means everyone is mix of machine and human.
It demonstrates an app that interacts with a microchip that ins implemented in the brain.
The app shows the states of knowledge in the brain and information of the chip. 
Moreover, the knowledge can be bought in knowledge packages and the payment method is bitcoin. An underground group is behind the app and their main goal is that nobody has to take disadvantage due to educational deficit. Therefore, everybody with low budget should have the chance to get every knowledge, because there are companies that sell knowledge only for rich people and makes them to super humans.
